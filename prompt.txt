I want to build a php web app based on MySQL that will allow registered users to create a list of folks for whom the user wants to buy gifts at a certain settable price point and keep track of when those gifts are due - such as birthdays, anniversaries, etc. Each recipient should be its own object and each occasion also its own object. Two weeks before the gift is to be received, the app will connect via API to amazon and get a list of the top 5 most appropriate gifts with descriptions based on the recipients age, gender, cost, etc. and send an email to the user with that list including links to each item. An account needs to be set up with Amazon so that I get a commission on each referral sale made by a user.  Each  user can have multiple recipients and each recipient can have multiple occasions.  Each occasion can have multiple gift suggestions and each suggestion must be able to indicate if it was selected.  Recipients and occasions need to be able to be disabled if no longer relevant.

Recipients age is needed for most items, but the actual birthday is associated only with the Birthday occasions.  Likewise, an actual anniversary date is needed for Anniversary occasions.  The recipient age should be based on a drop down box asking for age category like child, adult, senior, elderly, etc. (maybe 8) with a Year of Birth required for the child category.
